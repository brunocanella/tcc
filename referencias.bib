Foreword If you mention the word embedded to most people, they'll assume you're talking about reporters in a war zone. Few dictionaries—including the canonical Oxford English Dictionary—link embedded to computer systems. Yet embedded systems underlie nearly all of the electronic devices used today, from cell phones to garage door openers to medical instruments. By now, it's nearly impossible to build anything electronic without adding at least a small microprocessor and associated software. 
Vendors produce some nine billion microprocessors every year. Perhaps 100 or 150 million of those go into PCs. That's only about one percent of the units shipped. The other 99 percent go into embedded systems; clearly, this stealth business represents the very fabric of our highly technological society. 
And use of these technologies will only increase. Solutions to looming environmental problems will surely rest on the smarter use of resources enabled by embedded systems. One only has to look at the network of 32-bit processors in Toyota's hybrid Prius to get a glimpse of the future.
